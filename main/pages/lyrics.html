        [Verse 1]
        I get up, I get down
        And I'm jumpin' around
        And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
        Been a hell of a ride
        But I'm thinking it's time to grow
        Bang! Bang! Bang!
        So I got an apartment across from the park
        Put quinoa in my fridge
        Still, I'm not feeling grown
        Been a hell of a ride
        But I'm thinking it's time to go
        Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)

        [Chorus]
        So put your best face on everybody
        Pretend you know this song everybody
        Come hang (Come hang)
        Let's go out with a bang!
        Bang! Bang! Bang!
        I'm way too young to lie here forever
        I'm way too old to try so whatever
        Come hang
        Let's go out with a bang
        Bang! Bang! Bang!

        [Verse 2]
        Feel like I'm gonna puke
        'Cause my taxes are due
        Do my password begin with a one or a two?
        Been a hell of a ride
        But I'm thinking it's time to grow
        Bang! Bang! Bang! (Metronome!)
        Man, I'm up to somethin' (Up to somethin')
        Oo-dee-la-dee-doe
        Thank you all for comin' (All for comin')
        I hope you like the show
        'Cause it's on a budget (On a budget)
        So ooh-dee-la-dee-doe
        Yeah, come on here we go
        Yeah, come on (Here we go!)

        [Chorus]
        So put your best face on everybody
        Pretend you know this song everybody
        Come hang
        Let's go out with a bang
        Bang! Bang! Bang!
        I'm way too young to lie here forever
        I'm way too old to try, so whatever
        Come hang (Come hang)
        Let's go out with a bang
        Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang)
        Bang! Bang! Bang! (Bang, bang-bang-bang-bang, bang)
        [Bridge]
        Been a hell of a ride
        But I'm thinking it's time to go
        So put your best face on everybody
        Pretend you know this song everybody
        Come hang
        Let's go out with a bang!
        Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go!)

        [Chorus]
        So put your best face on everybody
        Pretend you know this song everybody
        Come hang
        Let's go out with a bang!
        I'm way too young to lie here forever
        I'm way too old to try so whatever
        Come hang (Come hang)
        Let's go out with a bang!
        Bang! Bang! Bang!

        Bang! Bang!
